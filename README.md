# Fire Engine

A Vulkan-based 3D renderer written in C++23, built on macOS with MoltenVK.

After I came out of Uni, my first real job was working as a software engineer for [Rare](https://www.rare.co.uk).
I started there working on their R&D team, developing what would be called the 'REngine' - a shared 3D engine that was used be used for a bunch of future Gamecube releases (but not Perfect Dark Zero they did their own).
During those days I had a design for a 3D engine I'd create it Gamecube limitations wheren't a problem (tesselated surfaces, spline based animation and softbody skinning, and 'correct' collision detection).
I've no doubt these are all solved problems nowadays with the Unreal engine et all, but since I've been reading up on the tech again, I thought it would fun to dip my toes in again with Vulkan.

## Features

- **glTF 2.0 model loading** via [fastgltf](https://github.com/spnda/fastgltf) — geometry, full PBR material set (base-colour, metallic-roughness, normal, occlusion + `occlusionStrength`, emissive, **transmission**), per-texture sampler settings, **per-slot UV-set selection (TEXCOORD_0 / TEXCOORD_1)**, skeletal skins, morph targets (POSITION + NORMAL + TANGENT deltas), keyframe animations, and alpha-mode state (OPAQUE / MASK / BLEND, `alphaCutoff`, `doubleSided`). Supported extensions: `KHR_materials_emissive_strength`, `KHR_texture_transform`, `KHR_materials_unlit`, **`KHR_lights_punctual`**, **`KHR_materials_transmission`**. Authored cameras are adopted as the engine's runtime view; authored lights drive the scene. Unsupported `extensionsRequired` rejected with a clear error; non-Triangles primitives skipped with a warning
- **Tangent-space normal mapping** — tangents generated on load when a material uses a normal texture (per-triangle UV derivatives, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation, handedness preserved in `tangent.w`). **Smooth-normal fallback** synthesises per-vertex normals when the source mesh omits NORMAL (e.g. Fox.gltf)
- **Physically based shading with split-sum IBL + multi-scatter compensation** — equirectangular HDR skybox is converted to an environment cubemap (1024², 11 mip levels), a diffuse irradiance cubemap (32²), a GGX prefiltered specular cubemap (128², 8 mips, importance-sampled with 256 Hammersley samples and Filament-style mip-LOD weighting against the source cubemap's mip chain), and a BRDF integration LUT (256²) at startup. Forward fragment shader uses Fdez-Aguera multi-scatter compensation so rough conductors stay energy-conserving across the roughness range
- **PCSS shadows on a 4-cascade CSM** — 4 cascades, 2048×2048 per cascade in a 2D-array depth image, log-uniform splits over 0.1m–50m. **Per-fragment PCSS**: 16-tap Poisson-disk **blocker search** (raw-depth read via a non-comparison sampler at binding 15) → contact-hardening **penumbra** = `(receiverDepth − avgBlocker) / avgBlocker × lightSize` → 16-tap Poisson-disk **variable-radius PCF** via `sampler2DArrayShadow` hardware comparison, with per-pixel rotation hash to break up moiré. Per-cascade bias scaling, 10% blend bands at boundaries
- **KHR_materials_unlit** — flagged materials skip BRDF/IBL/shadow entirely and output the textured base colour directly. Used for skybox cards, foliage, decals, UI quads
- **KHR_texture_transform** — per-slot UV offset/scale/rotation from the extension is applied to each texture sample. Identity by default
- **Multi-light scenegraph** — `Light` is a first-class component variant alongside Camera / Mesh / Animator / Empty. Type enum is **Directional / Point / Spot**, with colour, intensity, range, and inner/outer cone angles per spec. Each frame the scenegraph walks all lights into a packed `Lighting` array (cap `MAX_LIGHTS = 8`), the renderer picks the first directional as the CSM source, and the forward shader runs a per-fragment loop over the array. Point/spot use the KHR_lights_punctual attenuation (`windowing² / d²` with `windowing = clamp(1 − (d / range)⁴, 0, 1)`); spot adds a smooth cone factor on top
- **KHR_lights_punctual import** — glTF lights become `Light` nodes, transform-driven. FireEngine seeds a default directional Sun only when the asset hasn't authored one
- **KHR_materials_transmission** — basecolor passes through transmissive materials with a small env-irradiance tint, additive on top of an attenuated diffuse. Renders thin lampshades / paper / frosted glass against the environment correctly. Proper scene-behind-glass refraction (sceneColor mip chain) is a future stage
- **Authored-camera adoption** — `GltfLoader::findFirstCamera` walks the default scene's node tree DFS and returns the first camera-bearing node's view; FireEngine reframes its runtime camera to match before the first frame
- **HDR offscreen forward pass + bloom + ACES post-process** — forward writes into an R16G16B16A16 target. **Dual-filter bloom** (6-mip RGBA16F chain at half-screen res, 13-tap CoD downsample with Karis-average on the first pass to suppress fireflies, 9-tap tent upsample with additive blend) produces a low-pass HDR contribution. Post-process mixes the HDR target with bloom mip 0 (`bloomStrength = 0.04` default; `0` is bit-identical to a no-bloom path), then ACES tonemap + gamma 2.2 before presenting
- **Keyframe animation** with per-channel interpolation (LINEAR with SLERP for quaternions, STEP, CUBICSPLINE with in/out tangents) across rotation, translation, scale, and morph weight channels; looping playback; runtime animation selection via `AnimationState`
- **Skeletal skinning** — GPU joint matrix blending, up to 64 joints per skin
- **Morph target animation** — vertex POSITION + NORMAL + TANGENT deltas uploaded as a single packed SSBO, blended by weights in the vertex shader (up to 8 targets per mesh). Tangent morphs feed the TBN reconstruction so facial-rig normal mapping stays correct mid-blend
- **Alpha blending and masking** — three forward pipeline variants (opaque, double-sided opaque, blend) dispatched per draw from the material's `AlphaMode`/`doubleSided` flags. MASK handled via a fragment-shader discard test; BLEND uses straight-alpha blending with depth-write disabled and back-to-front sort of translucent draws
- **Scenegraph architecture** — tree of Nodes with Component variants (Camera, Animator, Mesh, Empty, **Light**) that propagate transforms, an `InputState` bundle, and draw commands. Node transforms store rotation as a quaternion so orientations from glTF round-trip exactly
- **Custom collision and physics path** — glTF `extras.Physics` can create `Static`, `Kinematic`, and `Dynamic` bodies with layer/mask filtering, authored AABB/box/sphere/capsule proxy shapes, linear velocity, mass, restitution, friction, and gravity scale. `PhysicsWorld` owns body/collider state, `SweepAndPruneBroadPhase` gathers AABB candidate pairs, `NarrowPhase` performs swept-AABB time-of-impact tests, and `SceneGraph::submitPhysics` / `SceneGraph::applyPhysics` bridge scene-authored and physics-authored transforms each frame
- **Backend-decoupled graphics layer** — graphics classes use opaque handles (`BufferHandle`, `TextureHandle`, `DescriptorSetHandle`, `PipelineHandle`) and emit `DrawCommand` structs with no Vulkan dependencies. IBL cubemaps, BRDF LUT, shadow map, bloom chain are all owned by the render layer and referenced through the same handle types
- **Vulkan rendering** via vulkan.hpp C++ bindings with a 17-binding forward descriptor set, plus separate descriptor layouts for skybox, shadow, post-process, and bloom passes
- **Single source of truth for tunables** — every rendering knob (light intensity, IBL strengths, shadow biases, bloom strength, cascade count, PCSS light size, IBL extents, camera FOV) lives in `include/fire_engine/render/constants.hpp`
- **Texture mapping** via [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb), including HDR equirectangular loading for the skybox; uploaded to GPU through staging buffers
- **First-person camera** with keyboard (WASD + E/F for vertical) and mouse controls
- **GLSL shaders** compiled to SPIR-V at build time via `glslc`

## How It Works

### Scenegraph

The engine uses a scenegraph where each `Node` holds a `Transform` (position, unit-quaternion rotation, scale), a `Component`, optional `Controllable` input behaviour, optional physics handles, child ownership, and a cached composed-world matrix. Components are stored as a `std::variant<Empty, Animator, Camera, Mesh, Light>`. Each component implements the update/render behaviour relevant to that component:

- **Camera** integrates per-frame deltas from `InputState::cameraState()` (deltaPosition, deltaYaw, deltaPitch, deltaZoom) into absolute position and orientation. Pitch is clamped to ±1.5 rad. FireEngine owns the active Camera directly and passes its position/target to the renderer each frame.
- **Animator** owns an `Animation` (per-channel Linear/Step/CubicSpline interpolation across rotation, translation, scale, and morph weight keyframes). Each frame it samples the animation at the current elapsed time, producing a TRS matrix that is applied to all child nodes. It also consults `InputState::animationState()` to switch between animations at runtime.
- **Mesh** wraps an `Object` that manages GPU resources via opaque handles. During render traversal it calls `Object::render()` which writes UBO data to mapped memory and returns `DrawCommand` structs.
- **Light** carries a `Type` (Directional / Point / Spot), `Colour3`, intensity, range, and inner/outer cone angles. Position and forward direction come from the node's `composedWorld` matrix at gather time — KHR_lights_punctual convention has the light forward as the node's local −Z. `SceneGraph::gatherLights()` walks the tree once per frame and returns a `std::vector<Lighting>` for the renderer to pack into the LightUBO array. `SceneGraph::hasDirectionalLight()` lets FireEngine skip seeding its default Sun when an asset has authored its own.
- **Empty** is a no-op component for structural nodes (joint bones, group nodes).

`Node` does not own physics objects directly. It stores `PhysicsBodyHandle` and `PhysicsColliderHandle` values when the glTF node has `extras.Physics`. `PhysicsWorld` owns the actual bodies/colliders and `SceneGraph` synchronizes transforms across that boundary with `submitPhysics()` and `applyPhysics()`.

### Collision And Physics

Physics is split across three layers:

- **`collision/`** contains low-level collision primitives. `Collider` stores local/world/swept AABBs, collision layer/mask filtering, a stable `ColliderId`, and six owned SAP `EndPoint`s. `SweepAndPruneBroadPhase` owns endpoint lists and emits broadphase `CollisionPair`s. `NarrowPhase` currently provides swept-AABB contact tests.
- **`physics/`** owns simulation state. `PhysicsWorld` stores bodies, colliders, shapes, materials, the broadphase, and the narrowphase. `PhysicsBody` stores type, velocity, mass/inverse mass, angular velocity, gravity scale, restitution, and friction. `ColliderShape` supports AABB, box, sphere, and capsule authoring, with all explicit shapes currently converted to an AABB proxy for contact testing.
- **`scene/`** stores only opaque physics handles. Scene nodes stay responsible for transforms, hierarchy, input, animation, and rendering; physics ownership stays in `PhysicsWorld`.

The frame loop makes the authority split explicit:

```cpp
scene_.update(input_state);
scene_.submitPhysics(physics_);

while (accumulator >= fixedDt)
{
    physics_.step(fixedDt);
    accumulator -= fixedDt;
}

scene_.applyPhysics(physics_);
```

`submitPhysics()` pushes non-dynamic scene transforms into `PhysicsWorld`: static bodies are scene-authored, and kinematic bodies are gameplay/input-authored. `PhysicsWorld::step()` integrates dynamic bodies, refreshes collider AABBs, updates broadphase candidates, runs swept-AABB narrowphase, applies the current simple response, and captures previous positions for the next swept test. `applyPhysics()` pulls non-static physics transforms back onto scene nodes, so dynamic simulation and kinematic collision correction are visible before rendering.

Physics can be authored in glTF through node `extras.Physics`. The loader creates bodies/colliders, assigns handles to the node, and rejects unsupported combinations such as a `Dynamic` body on a `Controllable` node.

### Graphics/Render Boundary

The `graphics/` layer is fully decoupled from Vulkan:

- **Opaque handles** — `BufferHandle`, `TextureHandle`, `DescriptorSetHandle`, and `PipelineHandle` are scoped enums backed by `uint32_t`. Graphics classes store these instead of Vulkan objects. The IBL cubemaps, BRDF LUT, and shadow map live behind the same handle types.
- **Resources** (in `render/`) — owns all Vulkan GPU resources (buffers, textures, descriptor pools/sets, registered pipelines, IBL cubemaps, BRDF LUT, shadow map). Graphics classes call `Resources` methods during `load()` to create buffers, textures, and descriptor sets, and receive handles back.
- **DrawCommand** — a backend-agnostic struct containing handle references (including the `PipelineHandle` to bind), an index count, and a `sortDepth` used for back-to-front ordering of translucent draws. `Object::render()` returns a vector of these; the Renderer resolves handles to Vulkan objects and records the actual draw calls.
- **FrameInfo** — plain data struct carrying frame index, viewport dimensions, camera vectors, and the `AlphaPipelines` bundle so graphics code can pick the right pipeline per material without touching Vulkan types.

### Loading

`GltfLoader` parses a glTF 2.0 file using fastgltf and builds the scenegraph. For each glTF node:

- If the node has an animation channel, it creates a three-level hierarchy: root Node (with the node's TRS transform) -> Animator Node (with keyframe data, preserving each channel's interpolation mode) -> Mesh Node.
- Otherwise, the node maps directly with its transform and mesh data.
- Skin data (joint references and inverse bind matrices) is loaded and attached to the relevant Mesh nodes.
- Morph target deltas (position, normal, **and tangent**) are stored per-geometry and uploaded as a single packed SSBO.
- Materials gather up to six textures (base-colour, emissive, normal, metallic-roughness, occlusion, **transmission**), each with its own `SamplerSettings`, a `TextureEncoding` (Srgb or Linear), a per-slot UV-set index (TEXCOORD_0 or TEXCOORD_1), and a per-slot `UvTransform` from KHR_texture_transform (offset / scale / rotation; identity by default).
- **Smooth-normal fallback** runs when the source mesh omits the `NORMAL` attribute (Fox.gltf and similar). A static `GltfLoader::generateSmoothNormals` builds per-vertex normals from positions + indices via area-weighted accumulate-and-normalize, with an up-pointing fallback for unreferenced vertices.
- **Tangent generation** runs automatically when a material has a normal texture and the glTF did not already supply TANGENT data. A custom per-triangle routine computes T and B from UV derivatives, Gram-Schmidts T against the vertex normal, and writes handedness into `tangent.w`. Degenerate UVs fall back to a normal-derived tangent so the mesh still shades reasonably.
- **Material extensions** — `KHR_materials_emissive_strength` is multiplied into emissive at load time so HDR emissives reach the bloom chain at the authored magnitude. `KHR_materials_unlit` flips a flag on the Material that the fragment shader uses to skip BRDF/IBL/shadow. `KHR_texture_transform` is read per slot and applied in shader before each sample. **`KHR_materials_transmission`** populates `transmissionFactor`, `transmissionTexture`, per-slot UV-set + `UvTransform`; the fragment shader attenuates the diffuse lobe by `(1 − transmission)` and adds a separate transmission lobe (basecolor pass-through with a small irradiance tint) on top.
- **Light extensions** — `KHR_lights_punctual.lights` are loaded into the asset's lights array; nodes carrying a `lightIndex` get a `Light` component (skipped with a warning if the node already holds a Mesh / Animator). Type / colour / intensity / range / cone angles all map directly. `FireEngine::loadScene` checks `SceneGraph::hasDirectionalLight()` after load and seeds a default Sun only when no directional was authored.
- **Camera extension** — `GltfLoader::cameraViewFromMatrix` resolves a node's accumulated world transform into a `(position, target)` viewpoint (glTF cameras look down −Z in local space). FOV / near / far stay engine-side; first-cut adoption is position + look direction only.
- **Physics extras** — `extras.Physics` can create `Static`, `Kinematic`, or `Dynamic` bodies. Supported custom fields include `Layer`, `Mask`, `Velocity`, `Mass`, `Restitution`, `Friction`, `GravityScale`, `Shape`, `Center`, `HalfExtents`, `Radius`, and `HalfHeight`. If no shape is supplied, the loader uses the mesh POSITION bounds as an AABB proxy.
- **Safety checks** — `GltfLoader::ensureSupportedExtensions` walks `asset.extensionsRequired` and throws if any aren't in our supported set (so e.g. draco-compressed assets fail fast instead of producing corrupt geometry). Non-triangle primitives are skipped with a `std::clog` warning rather than rendered as garbage.

Animation keyframes (input times and output quaternions/vectors/weights, plus CUBICSPLINE tangents) are read from glTF accessor data and set on the Animator's `Animation`.

### Startup: IBL Precompute

Before the first frame, the renderer runs a one-shot precompute chain using transient pipelines and one-time-submit command buffers:

1. **Equirectangular → cubemap** — load the HDR skybox and render 6 cubemap faces into a 1024² RGBA32F cubemap by sampling the equirectangular map along per-face direction vectors. After the 6-face pass, a `vkCmdBlitImage` chain generates the full 11-mip pyramid (1024 → 1) so the prefilter pass can do mip-weighted importance sampling.
2. **Irradiance convolution** — produce a 32² RGBA32F cubemap via cosine-weighted hemisphere integration (diffuse IBL).
3. **GGX specular prefilter** — produce a 128² RGBA32F cubemap with 8 mip levels. Roughness is pushed as a push constant per mip; each fragment importance-samples GGX with Hammersley + 256 samples, picking a blurrier source-cubemap mip when the PDF is low (Filament's mip-weighted importance sampling) so rough lobes stay shimmer-free.
4. **BRDF integration LUT** — 256² RGBA32F 2D; x = NdotV, y = roughness; outputs (scale, bias) for the Fresnel split-sum. No input textures required.

The transient pipelines are destroyed once the bake completes; only the resulting cubemaps + LUT remain and are bound into the forward shader's descriptor set every frame.

### Frame Loop

1. `FireEngine::mainLoop()` polls GLFW, calls `input_.update(window, dt)` to produce an `InputState`, then `scene_.update(inputState)`.
2. `SceneGraph::update()` propagates `InputState` and transforms down the node tree; each Node caches its `composedWorld` matrix for skin joint lookups.
3. `scene_.submitPhysics(physics_)` pushes static/kinematic scene transforms into `PhysicsWorld`.
4. `PhysicsWorld::step(1.0f / 60.0f)` runs zero or more fixed substeps from the frame accumulator.
5. `scene_.applyPhysics(physics_)` pulls dynamic and corrected kinematic transforms back into scene nodes and resolves composed-world matrices.
6. `Renderer::drawFrame()` acquires a swapchain image and records **five sub-passes**:
   - **Shadow pass** — looped 4 times, once per cascade. Each iteration begins a depth-only pass on its own framebuffer (one shadow-map array layer), pushes the cascade index as a push constant, and replays all collected shadow `DrawCommand`s. `shadow.vert` projects with `lightViewProj[cascadeIndex]` from the per-draw `ShadowUBO`. Skin and morph still apply
   - **Forward pass** — begin the HDR offscreen pass, draw the skybox (LEQUAL depth, no write), then call `scene.render(ctx)`; Mesh/Object emit `DrawCommand`s that the Renderer buckets into opaque vs blend, sorts the blend bucket back-to-front by `sortDepth`, and replays through the same bind/draw loop resolving handles via `Resources`
   - **Bloom downsample chain** — 6 fullscreen-triangle passes. Pass 0 reads the HDR target with the Karis-average 13-tap kernel (firefly suppression), writing mip 0 of the bloom chain. Passes 1..5 read the previous bloom mip and write the next, plain CoD weights
   - **Bloom upsample chain** — 5 fullscreen-triangle passes back up the chain (mip 5 → mip 4 → … → mip 0). Each samples its source mip with a 9-tap tent kernel and **additively blends** onto the destination mip (preserved by `loadOp=eLoad`). The final write to mip 0 carries the summed contribution from every coarser mip
   - **Post-process pass** — begin the swapchain-format pass, draw a fullscreen triangle that samples both the HDR target and bloom mip 0, mixes them by `bloomStrength`, and applies ACES + gamma 2.2
7. Renderer submits the command buffer and presents

### Rendering Pipeline

- Forward descriptor set with **17 bindings**:
  - 0 model/view/projection + camera position UBO
  - 1 Material UBO — `diffuseAlpha`, `emissiveRoughness`, `materialParams` (metallic, normalScale, alphaCutoff, occlusionStrength), `textureFlags` (base/emissive/normal/MR present), `extraFlags` (occlusion present, occlusion's UV-set, **unlit flag**), `texCoordIndices` (per-slot UV-set), `uvBaseColor / uvEmissive / uvNormal / uvMetallicRoughness / uvOcclusion / uvTransmission` (KHR_texture_transform offset+scale per slot), `uvRotations` + `uvRotationsExtra` (per-slot rotations, occlusion in `.x`, transmission in `.y`), `transmissionParams` (factor, texture-present flag, texCoord index)
  - 2 base-colour sampler
  - 3 skin UBO (joint matrices, `mat4[64]`)
  - 4 morph UBO (metadata + weights)
  - 5 morph targets SSBO — `[positions, normals, tangents]` per target as `vec4[]`
  - 6 emissive sampler
  - 7 normal sampler
  - 8 metallic-roughness sampler
  - 9 occlusion sampler
  - 10 cascaded shadow map (`sampler2DArrayShadow`, 4 layers, hardware PCF comparison)
  - 11 Light UBO — `cascadeViewProj[4]`, `cascadeSplits`, IBL params, shadow params with PCSS light size, environment params with CSM debug-tint flag in `.w`, `lightCount`, and `LightData lights[MAX_LIGHTS]` (per-light position/direction/colour/cone in std140-aligned `vec4`s)
  - 12 irradiance cubemap
  - 13 prefiltered environment cubemap
  - 14 BRDF integration LUT (2D)
  - **15 cascaded shadow map again, but with a non-comparison sampler so PCSS can read raw depths during the blocker search**
  - **16 transmission sampler (KHR_materials_transmission)**
- Separate descriptor layouts for the skybox (SkyboxUBO + samplerCube + LightUBO), shadow (ShadowUBO with `lightViewProj[4]` + SkinUBO + MorphUBO + MorphTargets SSBO, plus `ShadowPushConstants { int cascadeIndex }` on the vertex stage), post-process (HDR sampler at 0 + bloom mip 0 sampler at 1, plus `PostProcessPushConstants { float bloomStrength }`), and bloom-down / bloom-up (single input mip sampler + `BloomPushConstants` on the fragment stage)
- Three forward pipeline variants share the shader + binding layout but differ in cull mode, blend, and depth-write state:
  - **opaque** (cull back, no blend, depth write) — OPAQUE and MASK materials with `doubleSided=false`
  - **opaque-double-sided** (cull none, no blend, depth write) — OPAQUE and MASK with `doubleSided=true`
  - **blend** (cull none, `SRC_ALPHA / ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA` blend, no depth write) — BLEND materials
- Additional persistent pipelines: **skybox** (fullscreen triangle, LEQUAL depth, no write), **shadow** (front-face cull, depth bias enabled, color write off), **post-process** (bloom mix + ACES + gamma, no depth), **bloom-down** (no blend, no depth, fullscreen triangle), **bloom-up** (additive eOne/eOne blend, no depth, fullscreen triangle)
- Transient IBL pipelines (`environment_convert`, `irradiance_convolution`, `prefilter_environment`, `brdf_integration`) exist only during the startup precompute
- MASK is implemented via a fragment-shader `discard` when `alpha < alphaCutoff`; OPAQUE/BLEND write `alphaCutoff = 0.0` so the discard is inert
- Resources class owns all GPU resources and exposes opaque handles (pipeline registry, IBL cubemaps, BRDF LUT, shadow map with both compare + linear samplers, **bloom chain**)
- Each Object creates its own descriptor pool and sets via Resources
- Depth buffering and swapchain recreation on window resize (HDR framebuffer, bloom chain, post-process descriptors all rebuilt at new extent)

### Vertex Shader Pipeline

1. **Morph targets** (if enabled): accumulates weighted **position / normal / tangent** deltas from the packed SSBO (layout `[positions, normals, tangents]` per target)
2. **Skinning** (if enabled): blends joint matrices using per-vertex joint indices and weights
3. **Transform**: applies either the blended skin matrix or the model matrix to produce world-space position
4. **TBN construction**: transforms the morph-blended normal and tangent by the normal matrix, orthogonalises T against N, builds B via `cross(N, T) * tangent.w`, and passes `mat3(T, B, N)` to the fragment shader for tangent-space normal mapping
5. **Second UV set + view-space depth**: forwards `fragTexCoord1 = inTexCoord1` (location 8) and `fragViewDepth = -(view * worldPos).z` (location 7) for cascade selection

### Fragment Shader

The forward fragment shader picks a UV stream per sample (`pickUv(material.texCoordIndices.X)` returns TEXCOORD_0 or TEXCOORD_1), applies KHR_texture_transform (`applyUvTransform` does scale → CCW rotate → translate) and samples the right texture. If `material.extraFlags.z == 1` (KHR_materials_unlit) it writes `vec4(baseColor, alpha)` and returns immediately, skipping all lighting. Otherwise it runs a PBR Cook-Torrance BRDF (GGX + Schlick Fresnel + Smith G) **per light in a fixed-size loop over `light.lights[0..lightCount]`** — directional, point, and spot all share the same BRDF; point/spot add the KHR_lights_punctual `windowing² / d²` distance attenuation, spot adds a smooth cone factor, and only the first directional (`i == 0 && type == 0`) carries the PCSS shadow term. After the loop it adds diffuse IBL from the irradiance cubemap and specular IBL via the prefiltered cubemap + BRDF LUT split-sum **with Fdez-Aguera multi-scatter compensation** for energy-conserving rough conductors. **KHR_materials_transmission** then attenuates the diffuse lobes by `(1 − transmission)` and adds a separate transmission lobe (basecolor pass-through with a small irradiance-tint contribution from the refracted direction) on top. The PCSS shadow term is itself: 16-tap Poisson-disk blocker search (raw depths via the binding-15 sampler) → contact-hardening penumbra → 16-tap variable-radius Poisson-disk PCF rotated per pixel, picking one of 4 cascades per fragment with a 10% blend band at boundaries.

## Setup

Setup [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) on the build machine, and ensure that `VCPKG_ROOT` is available in the `PATH` environment variable.
Details of how to do this can be found at steps 1 and 2 in this [getting started doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/vcpkg/get_started/get-started).
Ensure the `vcpkg` executable is available in your `PATH`.

Configure CMake, which will install and build dependencies via vcpkg.
Additionally, since I use `NeoVim`, I export the `compile_commands.json` to the build directory for use with `clangd`:

```bash
cmake --preset=vcpkg -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
```

Build:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

Run the tests (912 tests):

```bash
./build/test_fire_engine
```

Run the application:

```bash
cd build && ./fireEngineApp
```

The app accepts two optional positional arguments:

```bash
./fireEngineApp <scene.gltf> <skybox.hdr>
```

Both fall back to built-in defaults when omitted. A single `.hdr`/`.exr` argument is treated as a
skybox path, so `./fireEngineApp nightbox.hdr` keeps the default scene and swaps only the
environment.

## Dependencies

Managed via vcpkg:

- `vulkan-headers` — Vulkan API headers
- `fastgltf` — glTF 2.0 parser
- `stb` — image loading (stb_image, incl. HDR)
- `gtest` — Google Test framework

Also requires:

- System GLFW 3.3+
- Vulkan SDK (for `glslc` shader compiler)

## Assets

All glTF models are from the Khronos glTF Sample Models [repository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/main): AlphaBlendModeTest, AnimatedCube, AnimatedMorphCube, BoomBoxWithAxes, BoxAnimated, BrainStem, CesiumMan, DamagedHelmet, Fox, InterpolationTest, **LightsPunctualLamp** (exercises KHR_lights_punctual + KHR_materials_transmission), MetalRoughSpheres, MorphPrimitivesTest, OrientationTest, RecursiveSkeletons, RiggedSimple, TextureCoordinateTest, TextureLinearInterpolationTest, TextureSettingsTest, VertexColorTest.

HDR equirectangular skyboxes (`skybox.hdr`, `nightbox.hdr`) drive the IBL precompute.
