# Very early stage Vulkan engine in C++

After I came out of Uni, my first real job was working as a software engineer for [Rare](https://www.rare.co.uk).
I started there working on their R&D team, developing what would be called the 'REngine' - a shared 3D engine that was used be used for a bunch of future Gamecube releases (but not Perfect Dark Zero they did their own).
During those days I had a design for a 3D engine I'd create it Gamecube limitations wheren't a problem (tesselated surfaces, spline based animation and softbody skinning, and 'correct' collision detection).
I've no doubt these are all solved problems nowadays with the Unreal engine et all, but since I've been reading up on the tech again, I thought it would fun to dip my toes in again with Vulkan.

## Setup

Setup [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) on the build machine, and ensure that VCPKG_ROOT is available in the PATH environment variable.
Details of how to do this can be found at steps 1 and 2 in this [getting started doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/vcpkg/get_started/get-started).
Ensure the `vcpkg` executable is available in your `PATH`.

Configure CMake, which will install and build dependencies via vcpkg.
Additionally, since I use `NeoVim`, I export the `compile_commands.json` to the build directory to for use with `clangd`:

```bash
cmake --preset=vcpkg -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
```

Build the test via CMake:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

Run the tests:

```bash
./build/test_fire_engine
```

```bash
cd build && ./fireEngineApp

```
